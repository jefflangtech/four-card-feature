##Layout Notes

I'll use my standard grid layout on the body to center main, with the side columns minmax'd to the dimensions on mobile up to 1fr.

The cards section appears to be a grid of 4 rows with both row and col gap (equal dims). The top and bottom cards, in the middle will span rows 1 & 2, and 3 & 4 respectively. The side cards will span rows 2 & 3. 

###Header

This will contain an <hgroup> with a <p> and the <h1>. I don't think it's necessary to try to extend the grid to the upper section since it doesn't seem to fit as nicely. Instead the <header> can be a flex container with everything nicely center and a bit of gap, with a bottom margin to give it space between that and the cards section.

*update: actually I don't want to use the <hgroup> because then the <p> and the <h1> are children of that, instead of the header. Keep it simple.

###Card section

As previously noted, a 3-column, 4-row grid layout with gap. When it goes to mobile size the cards will simply span the 3 columns. 

I wonder if there is a way of identifying the cards somehow, and then they can just seamlessly flow from desktop to mobile? Actually, if I set them up in order as they are in mobile, and then control their cols/rows on desktop--I think what I can do is have an @media rule specifically for those.

*UPDATE* Might need to experiment with a 12-column layout since the tablet view has a middle arrangement of cards, kind of the opposite of what desktop has.

***After watching a great video by Kevin Powell, randomly, about flexbox, I realized I can probably do this with a flex container.
When it's in desktop mode, the flex container is ordered by column, and it appears to go in reverse. I am not sure how to get the first card to be solo in the column, and then the second and third card pushed to the middle (2nd) column, with the 4th card taking up the last. That I'll have to figure out.

Then in tablet/mobile mode it goes to rows (technically, mobile could go back to a single column, but 4 rows also does the trick) where on tablet, the first card again takes up the whole row, the 2nd and 3rd cards take up the second row, and the 4th card again brings up the rear.

##Okay, I got it:
A grid container in the body, with justify content center → all the content goes in the center column, using my handy clamp column technique for the outside columns. The content can naturally flow down from the top, each controlling it's own vertical spacing.

##Then the flexbox container, which will consist of the 4 cards inside, and will be flex-column (?) first then go to rows. The directionality of the rows will have to be considered for each layout. 


<main>
  <article>
    <header>
      <p>
      <h1>
      <p> → might need some sort of max-width?
      <div.flexbox>
        <div.card> * 4

###The Cards

I can't quite tell if the color at the top is a border or not...I think it might be the border top. Since it's rounded it will simply cut off with that look. That's what I'll try.

The card itself might be a flex container, with the heading and paragraph justified left, and the image justified right. Then the alignment might simply be a spacing. 

*update: I'll put the heading and paragraph into it's own container, then that will have a gap between itself and the image. Ugh, I'm not sure which will work better.
